##### CS 225 Data Structures
### **Team Contract (awachat2-jjtang2-venyaj2-tomsui2)**

**Communication**
1. Team Meetings: Our team will be meeting in person on Wednesdays from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM. In addition, one member of the team each week (starting with jjtang2) will take notes on a Google document detailing what the group does in each meeting.

2. Assistance: Each team member can be contacted through their cell phone numbers and discord. Our team also has an iMessage group chat. We as a group commit to responding to messages within 48 hours.

3. Respect: As members of this team, we commit to fostering an environment of respect and professionalism. In addition to having a designated note-taker each week, we will also have a designated team manager for the week. The team manager’s role is to make sure that all ideas shared during the meeting are heard and every member has a chance to voice their opinions. If there is a disagreement on how a part of the project should be done, decisions will be made by a simple majority. Each member of the team commits to adhering to decisions the majority makes, even if they personally disagree with them.

**Collaboration**

1. Work Distribution: Each week, we’ll decide during meetings what we want to have finished by our next meeting, as individuals and as a group. This will be decided through volunteering for tasks, but if no one is volunteering, we will distribute based on already distributed tasks, time commitments, and weekly availability. If any member is unhappy with their tasks, we will attempt to accommodate them according to the other members’ task preferences. Any special occasion decisions will be made on a case by case basis.

2. Time Commitment: Each member is expected to work between 2-6 hours per week on their assigned tasks. If a team member happens to go over 6 hours, the group will be notified so that tasks can be redistributed based on everyone’s ability to take on extra work that week. If a member works under 2 hours without notifying the others, we will resort to conflict resolution. 

3. Conflict Resolution: In case of conflicts, if the two parties cannot resolve conflicts, the other group members will come in and act as judge and jury and executioner. Also, majority rules.
